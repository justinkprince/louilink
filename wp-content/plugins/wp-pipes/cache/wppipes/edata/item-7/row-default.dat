LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) – Court documents revealed more information about the shooting that killed a 16-month-old girl and injured her mother.
According to the documents, multiple shots were fired at five people who were on the porch of 120 South 37th Street around 5:50 p.m. on Aug. 27.
Shots were then fired at the home next door where six people were on the porch, including NeRiah Miller, who was killed, and her mother Cierra Miller, who was injured.
[PREVIOUS STORY: Family receiving death threats after 16-month-old shot, killed] 
At least 40 shell casings were recovered from as many as seven pistols.
Many interviews in the filing make it appear the shooters were targeting a suspected gang leader in a neighboring house.
Four men have been charged with murder in the case, including Demarkus Tramber, who was reportedly shot at around 6:20 p.m. on May 29, in the 300 block of South 38th Street by gang members.
[PREVIOUS STORY: 4th suspect in toddlers murder surrenders]
A witness said Tramber and William McLemore were part of the Aug. 27 shootings.
Trey Anderson and Michael Dunn have also been charged.
Witness accounts indicate there are more suspects at large in the case.
