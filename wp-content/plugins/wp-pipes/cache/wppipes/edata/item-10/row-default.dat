While the pro-Mitch McConnell super PAC (Kentuckians for Strong Leadership) has raised $7.5 million in its campaign to attack Alison Lundergan Grimes, a smaller super PAC is backing Grimes election. And while less than one-tenth the size, the Grimes super PAC has still raised a significant amount.
The pro-Grimes super PAC is called We Are Kentucky. And it gets the vast majority of its money from labor unions.
We Are Kentucky reported Thursday to the FEC that it raised $357,700 during the first half of October, bringing its total raised to date to $700,702. And in recent weeks it has begun spending its money on mailings and radio advertising attacking McConnell.
People and regular political action committees are limited in how much they can give to a political campaign. But there are no limits on how much a person or group can give to a Super PAC that is running an independent campaign supporting a particular candidate.
In fact three labor organizations have given six figure contributions to We Are Kentucky. They are:
United Auto Workers Education Fund , Detroit, $200,000
International Association of Firefighters, Washington, $150,000
Plumbers and Pipefitters union, Annapolis, $100,000
