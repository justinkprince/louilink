<blockquote>
<p><strong>Louisville (7-3) at Notre Dame (7-3), 3:30 p.m., NBC. Line: Notre Dame by 3.5. </strong>The Irish have hit a bit of a rough patch the past few weeks, so this is the perfect time for the Cards to take advantage. Though&nbsp;<span>Will Gardner</span> is out for the season, freshman&nbsp;<span>Reggie Bonnafon</span> has playing experience and that will help. So will having&nbsp;<span>DeVante Parker</span> and&nbsp;<span>Michael Dyer</span> on his side. The Irish have had issues stopping both the run and the pass this season, so those two could be in for another big day. Plus, the Louisville offensive line is coming off its best performance of the season. Defensively,&nbsp;<span>Gerod Holliman</span> could create problems for turnover-prone&nbsp;<span>Everett Golson</span>, and&nbsp;<span>Lorenzo Mauldin</span> could be back, giving the defense a much needed boost. Plus, Louisville has had a week to prepare for this game so you can bet Bobby Petrino will have some new wrinkles for Notre Dame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PLAYER OF THE WEEK</strong>: Montrezl Harrell, Louisville</p>
<p>There were a lot of games during the first weekend of the college basketball season. There weren't a lot of meaningful games, however, as the most important matchup of the first three days of college hoops was relevant more for the coaching matchup than the game itself. Minnesota took on Louisville - and lost - and Richard Pitino couldn't knock off his dad, Rick.</p>
<p>That said, there was a bright spot for the Cardinals, as Montrezl Harrell looked every bit the part of an all-american. He finished with 30 points and seven boards, but that's not the whole story. Harrell, who spent the offseason trying to develop his perimeter skills, went 3-for-4 from three and knocked down 9-of-10 from the foul line. If he turns into a player that has to be covered out to the three-point line, he'll be borderline unstoppable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Take NOTRE DAME -3.5 over Louisville: </strong>In just a few short weeks, the Fighting Irish have gone from being legitimate contenders for the national playoffs to hanging on for their dear life to stay in the Top 25. Following a sloppy 55-31 loss to Arizona State as a three-point road underdog, Notre Dame blew an early lead against Northwestern in this past Saturday's stunning 43-40 overtime loss to Northwestern as a 17-point home favorite.</p>
<p>The third time will be the charm as the Irish get their act together this Saturday in South Bend. The Cardinals just wrapped-up their first run through the ACC as the conference's newest member with a 5-3 SU record. They are 7-3 overall this season with a 6-4 record ATS.</p>
<p>Louisville has done a good job at holding its own against the better teams it has faced this season, with tough losses to both Clemson and Florida State, but it comes into this game with a new starter at quarterback after Will Gardner went down with an injury. That will be tough to overcome on the road against a very testy Notre Dame squad.</p>

The answer is that the ACC has placed a six-day hold on five games, including the Cards vs. the Cats. This means that we won't know the start time until Saturday night at the earliest (also the most likely scenario) and Monday at the latest. A U of L loss this weekend would almost guarantee a noon kickoff, while a win over the Fighting Irish could push the game into a primetime slot.</p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:15:"Mike Rutherford";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:4:"date";s:19:"2014-11-18 18:43:41";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}s:7:"src_url";s:108:"http://www.cardchronicle.com/2014/11/18/7241827/tuesday-evening-cardinal-news-and-notes-louisville-cardinals";s:8:"src_name";s:39:"Tuesday Evening Cardinal News And Notes";}
