Still, I slept with Ray Ganong to get really good seats for the JSU game and there are a handful of important items from the experience that deserve at least a brief mention.</p>
<p>1. I frantically pulled out my phone in the game's final seconds hoping to capture video of Trent Gilbert sticking a three, but wound up getting a glorious shot of Matz Stockman's first points as a Card.</p>
<p><iframe class="vine-embed" src="https://vine.co/v/O53m9Qr1H7t/embed/simple" width="600" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<script src="//platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Matz then gave me a thumbs up as he was walking off the floor and I have been sleeping on a bed of Laffy Taffy (not banana) and Kelly Kapowskis ever since.</p>
<p>2. Rick Pitino was relatively subdued, saving his only real tongue-lashing for Anton Gill after Gill had let Jacksonville State's best 3-point shooter take mildly contested shots from beyond the arc on consecutive possessions. Pitino laid into Gill during a timeout and then again on the bench. He then started to walk away before turning around and adding, "do you not understand that the culture of Louisville basketball is built on defense?"</p>
<p>3. After Gill's mistake, an added emphasis must have been placed on recognizing where the shooter was on the floor. Two possessions later when he broke behind the line and looked to receive a pass, literally every player on Louisville's bench held up a hand and yelled in unison. It was pretty cool to see.</p>
<p>4. Fist-bumping every coach and every player during both pre-game introductions and whenever a player is taken out of the game is my new favorite U of L tradition. I think we were all concerned that this group might not be as likable or as easy to cheer for as the last four, but it seems like the group has really answered the bell when it comes to the "pass down the culture" talk.</p>
<p>5. When it comes to pure intimidation on a basketball court, the only player I'll put above Montrezl Harrell is Kenyon Martin. Watching both in person is akin to sitting close to the stage for a performance of "Dracula" when you were a kid. You know nothing bad is going to happen to you, but still ... it's a little nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>It's also so comforting to have a guy like that wearing your team's uniform. If I was Dillon Avare I would talk ish to everybody.</p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:15:"Mike Rutherford";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:4:"date";s:19:"2014-11-19 21:08:57";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:5:"title";s:56:"Past meets present and future this weekend in South Bend";s:4:"link";s:104:"http://www.cardchronicle.com/2014/11/19/7247785/louisville-notre-dame-football-2014-cardinals-south-bend";s:11:"description";s:5583:"<div><img alt="" src="//cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7fIkqMWEr5fDj7k3UMFhvfknWY8=/0x15:3000x2015/400x267/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/44188064/458652902.0.jpg"><p>Notre Dame has always had their remarkable history on their side, but how much of that respect has been earned recently? </p>
<p>Bobby Petrino and his Louisville Cardinals will head to South Bend this weekend for the first time in history. With them, they'll bring a program whose most recent success may very well be its best stretch ever. And when they take the field in front of a packed Notre Dame Stadium, they'll take on a program whose incredible past packs a much more potent punch than its present.</p>
<p>It's interesting how these two programs stack up against each other, because one (Louisville) has always had to claw for a hair of respect, where the other (Notre Dame) has almost always been entitled to it until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Brian Kelly's 2014 Notre Dame team, like many that have come recently before it, is a good team that represents a great tradition. It's easy to confuse these two things, because it's impossible to argue with the prolific history that goes along with the Fighting Irish name. Maybe that's why it's all the more important to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>Everything about the Irish is iconic. They're the only independent football program that consistently means anything. Because of this independence, you can watch them on national television every week. They are their own brand in every sense of the phrase. They have helmets adorned with real gold. You likely know the tune of "Victory March" whether you want to or not. They're the winningest program in the history of the college game, and that gives them a certain amount of claim to something.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>For the last two decades, though, Notre Dame football has meant something entirely different than its rightfully distinguished tradition suggests. Lou Holtz retired after the 1996 season, and with him left a sustained Irish tradition of excellence, at least where it really counts (on the field).</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2008, the Irish either didn't go to a bowl game (1996, '99, 2001, '03, '04, '07) or didn't win the one they did go to. In the two decades since 1994, Notre Dame has won three bowl games and has achieved a double-digit win total three times. Of those three seasons with 10 wins or more, none have ended in a bowl victory.</p>
<p>Sure, it's absolutely fair to point out that the 2012 Irish (12-1) were completely overmatched by a battle-tested Alabama in the BCS title game. And yes, it made sense that the 2007 team (10-2) was demolished by a similarly rugged LSU team. Maybe the 2003 Irish (10-3) just faced an especially tough NC State Wolfpack when they were blown out in that year's Gator Bowl. After all, it <i>was</i> Philip Rivers.</p>
<p>Therein lies the important distinction. Notre Dame does deserve credit for almost always being a good or very good team, but they haven't been great for almost 20 years. For parts of that period, they have even been fairly bad. Their history, tradition and hordes of devoted fans always have been and always will be among the best in college football, but they've fallen behind on the field fairly consistently. And when they've reached a national stage in January, they haven't shown up to the occasion since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Regardless of this, Notre Dame's tradition and all that surrounds it has always helped them on the field for some mysterious reason. The Irish are always given credit for something until they absolutely prove (sometimes it even takes a few tries) that they are not worthy of it. I remember one Saturday morning a few years ago when ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit said something to the effect that Notre Dame's football tradition had shifted from being a powerhouse to being fairly mediocre, and he was right.</p>
<p>Obviously, Herbstreit was speaking about the whole picture. Last year's Notre Dame team was far from bad or even average, as was the team before it that reached the National Championship game undefeated. Brian Kelly has brought a considerable measure of national relevance back to the program.</p>
<p>Which brings us to this season. Notre Dame lost close at Florida State, which led many to believe that they still belonged in the upper echelon. ESPN's Colin Cowherd even put the Irish in his top four after the loss. Since then, an all-too-familiar act has followed. Notre Dame struggled mightily against Navy and was demolished by Arizona State before falling at home to Northwestern.</p>
<p>Now, they'll host Louisville, which has weathered its first ACC season with some ups and downs but is eager to leave storied Notre Dame Stadium with a victory. The Cardinals have not made it easy this season, but they've grown through it and figure to be up to the task that the Fighting Irish will present.</p>
<p>Saturday will still be a historic moment for Louisville football in that it's the first time they've played Notre Dame, the best program in history. Off the field, all of the allure is still there, and that makes the game even more fun to think about. That shouldn't be completely discounted.</p>
<p>That allure is exactly what Notre Dame is counting on, though, because when it comes to earning victories on the field, their wonderful tradition and history won't be able to help them. They'll have to be up to the task presented by Louisville between the lines, and that is what should truly make Cardinal fans excited to be in South Bend this weekend.</p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:13:"Chris Gehring";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:4:"date";s:19:"2014-11-19 20:13:10";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":6:{s:5:"title";s:72:"Dominique Brown And Jamon Brown Accept East-West Shrine Game Invitations";s:4:"link";s:108:"http://www.cardchronicle.com/2014/11/19/7249349/dominique-brown-and-jamon-brown-accept-east-west-shrine-game";s:11:"description";s:1085:"<div><img alt="" src="//cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/627jkXHk5GpCWyzkqJbnsZ4HlWU=/54x0:3575x2347/400x267/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/44188370/454487276.0.jpg"><p>Louisville seniors Dominique Brown and Jamon Brown have each accepted invitations to participate in the 2015 East-West Shrine Game.</p>
<p>The college football all-star game, which matches standouts from teams in the Eastern United States against others from the West Coast, has been played every January since 1925.</p>
<p>Dominique Brown has carried the ball 95 times for 374 yards and four touchdowns for Louisville this season. He gave his best performance of the year in the Cards' season-opening win over Miami when he rushed 33 times for 143 yards and a score. He has not registered a carry in U of L's last three games.</p>
<p>Jamon Brown (no relation) is a product of Fern Creek High School who has started every game for the Cards since the beginning of his sophomore season. He also appeared in nine games, and started one, as a freshman in 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dewyulsc" target="_blank"></a>Capturing the National Championship sits atop the Cardinal wish list. An annual home and home series against any SEC opponent not named Kentucky or Vanderbilt probably comes in at number two, but if Mr. Rutherford was to conduct a city wide scientific poll I would speculate confronting Notre Dame on a yearly basis would claim position 2A. Cardinal fans from every existing generation have been begging for Saturday's showdown their entire lives. Louisville has waited five decades for this overdue pilgrimage and the Cardinals will undoubtedly leave a victorious mark on every corner of South Bend.</p>
<p>Considered by many as the New World's Vatican City, the University of Notre Dame and Notre Dame Stadium are two of the most revered institutions in the United States. Touchdown Jesus keeps a watchful eye on the Fighting Irish and a Notre Dame home game is on the bucket list of many sports enthusiasts. Louisville has deserved this game for quite some time, and if the basketball rivalry between the two schools is any indication, the football game should exceed all expectations.</p>
<p>I am making the journey Saturday morning, rain or shine, and it would not surprise me to see 15-25,000 Cardinal fans invade South Bend. Louisville possesses deep catholic roots and devout catholic sport fans are plentiful throughout the region. Families have spent generations supporting Trinity, St. Xavier, and DeSales, and every boy who passed through those halls as a football player had dreams of either playing for or against Notre Dame. Paul Hornung was a Louisville legend before becoming Notre Dame's "Golden Boy", and still remains one of this city's most cherished athletes. The ties that bind Louisville and Notre Dame are endless, making this endlessly avoided rivalry even more intriguing. Louisville will be ready for Saturday, but I don't think Notre Dame is, nor do they have any idea what kind of damage this Cardinal train will cause come kickoff.</p>
<p>Notre Dame appears to be a welcoming opponent for Louisville by almost every account. The Irish turn the ball over regularly, their defense is anything but stout, and their late game execution and stamina seems to be lacking. Notre Dame ranks 74th in passing defense, 51st in rushing defense, 92nd in passes that have been intercepted, 51st in time of possession, and have given up 21 sacks which is good for 68th.</p>
<p>At this juncture the weather doesn't seem to be on Louisville's side, but if decent conditions prevail I wouldn't be surprised to see a soul crushing Cardinal victory. Notre Dame is reeling and has very little left to play for. After being embarrassed by Arizona State, the Irish rebounded by collapsing against lowly Northwestern, and even the Wildcats were more excited about post-game Chik-Fil-A than beating Notre Dame. Louisville has had two full weeks to rest and prepare for Notre Dame, and Coach Petrino understands how vital this victory is to a successful season.</p>
<p>The biggest question mark for Louisville will be the play of true freshman Reggie Bonnafon. Much like Gardner, Reggie is benefitted immensely by a healthy Michael Dyer and the unstoppable Spiderman better known as DeVante Parker. Hail Mary pass to the pylon aside, Reggie was great against Boston College, and his running ability will contribute immensely to Louisville's control of possession Saturday afternoon. If I had to wager, the Louisville offense will even make Nick Saban proud due to the heavy reliance on an unshakeable ground game. Expect to see relentless waves of punishment from Dyer, Radcliffe, Scott, and Brown, and if all else fails Reggie, just throw it up to number nine.</p>
<p>The city of Louisville, Cardinal fans everywhere, and the University have been waiting their entire existence for an opportunity to defeat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on their own turf. Saturday will be a once&nbsp;in a lifetime experience for the coaches, players, and fans and I recommend everyone willing and able to take full advantage of this weekend. The Cardinal pilgrimage to South Bend has been long overdue and not even Touchdown Jesus will be able to save the golden domers Saturday afternoon.

<p><strong>Louisville (7-3) at Notre Dame (7-3), 3:30 p.m., NBC. Line: Notre Dame by 3.5. </strong>The Irish have hit a bit of a rough patch the past few weeks, so this is the perfect time for the Cards to take advantage. Though&nbsp;<span>Will Gardner</span> is out for the season, freshman&nbsp;<span>Reggie Bonnafon</span> has playing experience and that will help. So will having&nbsp;<span>DeVante Parker</span> and&nbsp;<span>Michael Dyer</span> on his side. The Irish have had issues stopping both the run and the pass this season, so those two could be in for another big day. Plus, the Louisville offensive line is coming off its best performance of the season. Defensively,&nbsp;<span>Gerod Holliman</span> could create problems for turnover-prone&nbsp;<span>Everett Golson</span>, and&nbsp;<span>Lorenzo Mauldin</span> could be back, giving the defense a much needed boost. Plus, Louisville has had a week to prepare for this game so you can bet Bobby Petrino will have some new wrinkles for Notre Dame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PLAYER OF THE WEEK</strong>: Montrezl Harrell, Louisville</p>
<p>There were a lot of games during the first weekend of the college basketball season. There weren't a lot of meaningful games, however, as the most important matchup of the first three days of college hoops was relevant more for the coaching matchup than the game itself. Minnesota took on Louisville - and lost - and Richard Pitino couldn't knock off his dad, Rick.</p>
<p>That said, there was a bright spot for the Cardinals, as Montrezl Harrell looked every bit the part of an all-american. He finished with 30 points and seven boards, but that's not the whole story. Harrell, who spent the offseason trying to develop his perimeter skills, went 3-for-4 from three and knocked down 9-of-10 from the foul line. If he turns into a player that has to be covered out to the three-point line, he'll be borderline unstoppable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Take NOTRE DAME -3.5 over Louisville: </strong>In just a few short weeks, the Fighting Irish have gone from being legitimate contenders for the national playoffs to hanging on for their dear life to stay in the Top 25. Following a sloppy 55-31 loss to Arizona State as a three-point road underdog, Notre Dame blew an early lead against Northwestern in this past Saturday's stunning 43-40 overtime loss to Northwestern as a 17-point home favorite.</p>
<p>The third time will be the charm as the Irish get their act together this Saturday in South Bend. The Cardinals just wrapped-up their first run through the ACC as the conference's newest member with a 5-3 SU record. They are 7-3 overall this season with a 6-4 record ATS.</p>
<p>Louisville has done a good job at holding its own against the better teams it has faced this season, with tough losses to both Clemson and Florida State, but it comes into this game with a new starter at quarterback after Will Gardner went down with an injury. That will be tough to overcome on the road against a very testy Notre Dame squad.</p>

The answer is that the ACC has placed a six-day hold on five games, including the Cards vs. the Cats. This means that we won't know the start time until Saturday night at the earliest (also the most likely scenario) and Monday at the latest. A U of L loss this weekend would almost guarantee a noon kickoff, while a win over the Fighting Irish could push the game into a primetime slot.</p></div>";s:6:"author";O:16:"SimplePie_Author":3:{s:4:"name";s:15:"Mike Rutherford";s:4:"link";N;s:5:"email";N;}s:4:"date";s:19:"2014-11-18 22:43:41";s:10:"enclosures";a:1:{i:0;O:19:"SimplePie_Enclosure":27:{s:7:"bitrate";N;s:8:"captions";N;s:10:"categories";N;s:8:"channels";N;s:9:"copyright";N;s:7:"credits";N;s:11:"description";N;s:8:"duration";N;s:10:"expression";N;s:9:"framerate";N;s:7:"handler";N;s:6:"hashes";N;s:6:"height";N;s:10:"javascript";N;s:8:"keywords";N;s:4:"lang";N;s:6:"length";N;s:4:"link";N;s:6:"medium";N;s:6:"player";N;s:7:"ratings";N;s:12:"restrictions";a:1:{i:0;O:21:"SimplePie_Restriction":3:{s:12:"relationship";s:5:"allow";s:4:"type";N;s:5:"value";s:7:"default";}}s:12:"samplingrate";N;s:10:"thumbnails";N;s:5:"title";N;s:4:"type";N;s:5:"width";N;}}}}
